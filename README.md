# Student Experience Survey – Zekelman School of IT
## Data Analytics for Business Program

**Business Problem**

The Data Analytics for Business program at St. Clair College faces challenges in effectively analyzing student trends and sentiments due to the absence of a centralized system for collecting and managing student data. This absence of organization limits visibility into student issues, potentially leading to a suboptimal student experience. To address these challenges, the project aims to provide an automated pipeline for collecting and utilizing student data, along with a Tableau dashboard for visualizing and analyzing this data. The pipeline will enable the monitoring and understanding of student needs and issues, including challenges related to accommodation, transportation, educational support, the college schedule, health services, and other areas, ultimately improving the overall student experience.

**Goals**

The main objective of this project is to collect and conduct a thorough analysis of data pertaining to all current students enrolled in the Data Analytics for Business program. This analysis will be used to identify key issues and potential solutions, which will be further presented through an interactive dashboard for management review. Additionally, the data will be analyzed using machine learning techniques to gain valuable insights and predictions. A final goal is to create a template that can be used by other departments for similar data collection and analysis.

**Stakeholders and Impact**

- Management will benefit from a streamlined and comprehensive solution for understanding student’s data and concerns.
- Students will have access to a platform for raising and addressing their concerns.
- Project team will have the opportunity to work on a practical problem and provide an effective solution.

**Success Criteria**

Measuring the success of a descriptive and exploratory dashboard project can be done through the following criteria:

- Data Accuracy: Ensure that the data displayed on the dashboard is accurate and up-to-date.
- Feedback: Collect feedback from users on the dashboard's design, usability, and usefulness.
- User Engagement: Track the number of students participating and provide insightful data.
- Trends and Analysis: Presence of some trends and connections between concerns and services.

It is important to note that measuring success will be specific to the goals and objectives of the project, and will vary depending on the context, audience and data being displayed.

**Methods**

Collection and analysis of data will be conducted in a step-by-step approach, consisting of three main phases:

**Phase 1: Primary Data Collection**
- Collection of primary data set through surveys.
- Setting up the data pipeline and initial data landing zone.
- Data engineering and exploratory data analysis (EDA) through a transformation engine or Python.
- Use of machine learning (ML) techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) on the entire dataset for sentimental analysis and predictive analysis.
- Conducting sentimental analysis on student feedback.
- Conducting predictive analysis on primary data set.

**Phase 2: Secondary Data Work**
- Collection of primary data set through surveys
- Setting up the data pipeline and initial data landing zone
- Data engineering and exploratory data analysis (EDA) through a transformation engine or Python
- Collection of secondary data sets through surveys and linked data
- Creation of a mapping mechanism for primary and secondary sets

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the Student Experience Survey project aims to improve the overall experience of students enrolled in the Data Analytics for Business program at St Clair College. By collecting and analyzing primary and secondary data through surveys and linked data, and using machine learning techniques such as sentiment analysis, the project aims to provide valuable insights into student trends and sentiments. The project also intends to create a centralized system for collecting and utilizing student data, as well as a mechanism for monitoring and understanding student needs and concerns. With the help of various tools such as Tableau, Python, and cloud-based technologies, the project team will work towards creating interactive dashboards that will aid management in making data-driven decisions to improve student satisfaction. The success of the project will be measured through data accuracy, feedback from users, adoption rate, user engagement, and trends and analysis. The project team comprises individuals with expertise in the specific data domain of students, Python & Machine Learning, Tableau, cloud-based technologies, data ethics and best practices, and survey/data collection.
