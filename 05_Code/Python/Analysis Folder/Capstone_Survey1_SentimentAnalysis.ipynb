            "We have a professor who is not able to teach correctly: she only reads the slides and she cannot explain the concepts correctly. Another factor is that this professor has a very strong accent and speaks very fast, which makes understanding her a challenge. Before assigning a professor to a class that has almost 100% international students, please assess whether that professor is able to express himself correctly. The content she creates is extremely confusing and generic, which makes no one understand what's going on. This course should not be so difficult, as it is an introduction, but unfortunately the teaching method used does not help students. 236 / 5.000 Resultados de tradução Resultado da tradução I am very disappointed with the college, because all the speech made at the beginning of the semester turned out to be false.

            "I am very disappointed with this program. The professors seem to expect students to have basic programming and coding knowledge, however this was not a requirement when applying to the program. This poses a problem as the professors do not teach basics of coding/programming in class and rely on online courses from DataCamp and other similar websites, while these courses might be helpful as an add-on to in-class learning, but if I had known this is the case, I would not have paid for this program and would have instead paid a fraction of the cost to enroll in those online courses. I am pointing this out as this is the basis of this program, if we do not properly learn coding/programming then how am I expected to build an entire capstone project?\n",

            "College should think of having 3 days per week,  and also college should follow strict day schedule rather having the classes in night. Also, college should reduce the assignments frequency so that students will get sometime to learn and think over it\n",
            "Class schedule should be more student centric, because they also have to work for their living expense and other bills. SUGGESTION: classes are 21 hr per week, we can study those in 3 days and the rest 4 days time we can invest in our other works. Regards\n"
